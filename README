This kit is meant to extend the serialization functionality provided by the 
.NET Framework. At first this library was meant to be a way to simplify the
creation of serialization engines but I found that most of the functionality I
was going to implement was already there but poorly documented.

Currently this kit provides the following abilities:
 - Instance specific serialization

Eventually this kit will provide:
 - A serialization formatter that converts an object into it's simplest
 representation to send across the boundaries of an application domain.
 The opcodes of this formatter are defined by the programmer to provide maximum
 flexibility.
